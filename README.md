# Lua

During my research that was driven by my passion for video game development, I came across a course on edX on Lua and Love2D. 
These platforms allow you to code and run 2D games. I have uploaded all games that I managed to code independentyl to this folder. 


------------- TO RUN THE GAMES -------------
To run the games you need to install love2D first. --> https://love2d.org/

After that you will need to download and save all the files for the game in one folder. Then in your terminal you would type the following; 

open -a love "path of the file"
